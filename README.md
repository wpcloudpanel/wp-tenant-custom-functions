# wp-tenant-custom-functions
This plugin is a starter template for your multi-tenant tenant sites.
Apply it to your TEMPLATE site and it will be copied to your new tenant sites.

In it's basic form it offers the following templates for you to follow:

- Replace on-screen terms
- Remove unnecessary wp-admin dashboard items
- Add items to the wp-admin area
- Load up global stylesheets you can use to apply your own styles (better than using the customizer since these styles will stick around if you change themes)

# How To Use
You can download the file .zip directly from [this repo](https://github.com/wpcloudpanel/wp-tenant-custom-functions/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

After downloading it, remove the "open-saas-tutorial-final-files" folder from the .zip.  If you do not do this WP will throw an error when you try to activate it.

After removing the folder, just upload the .zip and activate it as you would any other plugin.

# Why Use This?
Many of the functions in here are present in commercially available wp-admin customization plugins.
However, those plugins are code-heavy and offer dozens, sometimes hundreds of function points.
Many of which you might not need.

And some of those plugins heavily modify the WP UI.  They look good, but many plugins 
aren't compatible with them.  So you end up spending tons of time applying custom styles 
to make existing plugins fit into the new UI framework.

By using a custom plugin such as this one, you reduce the amount of code your site has to execute.
And it means that you will be able to run more sites on a single server.

More efficient code is always more cost-effective in the long run.
